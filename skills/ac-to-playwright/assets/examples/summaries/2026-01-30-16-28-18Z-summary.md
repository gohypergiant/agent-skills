# Post-creation summary

- Run date: 2026-01-30T16:28:18.640Z

## Inputs: AC files
- agent-skills/skills/ac-to-playwright/assets/examples/acceptance/sample-app-functionality.feature
- agent-skills/skills/ac-to-playwright/assets/examples/acceptance/sample-app.feature
- agent-skills/skills/ac-to-playwright/assets/examples/acceptance/sample-app.md

## Outputs: Playwright test files
- skills/ac-to-playwright/assets/examples/tests/basic-functionality.spec.ts
- skills/ac-to-playwright/assets/examples/tests/site-navigation.spec.ts
- skills/ac-to-playwright/assets/examples/tests/sample-app.spec.ts

## Next steps
- Copy the generated Playwright spec files into your project repo.
- Ensure the codebase includes the required test hooks (data-testid attributes on the appropriate elements). If there's any ambiguity, review the input AC file alongside the JSON plan to most easily see the intended test flow and targets.
- If Playwright isn't yet configured for your project and you requested the config template, copy it to your repo root and adjust baseURL, testDir, and reporter/output paths to match your project.
- Consider reviewing your Vitest (or other) test configs to make sure these new Playwright *.spec.ts files won't get picked up with other testing.
- Add a CI step to run Playwright and upload traces/screenshots on failure.
