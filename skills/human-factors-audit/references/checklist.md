Defense Software Human Factors Checklist
Autopilot-Inspired Framework for Mission-Critical Systems

This document provides a standardized human-factors checklist for defense and safety-critical software. The framework aligns with established aerospace and mission system practices and supports safer operations, faster decision-making, and reduced operator workload across all environments.

Executive Summary
• Maintain clear human authority over automation

• Ensure system behavior is transparent and explainable

• Design for degraded and high-stress conditions

• Reduce cognitive and physical workload

• Enable safe recovery from errors

• Support trust through predictable system behavior

Core Operating Principle
Automation assists operators while humans remain informed, engaged, and able to take control instantly. Systems must avoid surprises and degrade safely.

1. Authority — Human in Control
☐ Immediate manual override available

☐ Critical controls always visible

☐ Automation never blocks inputs

☐ Users can bypass automation

☐ System never conflicts with direct commands

Key Impacts
• Prevents lockouts

• Improves safety during unexpected events

• Builds operator confidence

2. Transparency — Explainable Behavior
☐ Current mode visible

☐ Decisions explainable

☐ Confidence levels shown

☐ Data sources visible

☐ Event history available

Key Impacts
• Improves trust

• Reduces training burden

• Speeds troubleshooting

3. Graceful Degradation — Fail Soft
☐ Early warnings before capability loss

☐ Step-down behavior instead of sudden failure

☐ Information fades rather than disappears

☐ Manual tools remain available

Key Impacts
• Maintains continuity

• Reduces cognitive spikes

• Supports safer recovery

4. Cognitive Load — Designed for Stress
☐ Limited simultaneous alerts

☐ Prioritized notifications

☐ Consistent layouts

☐ Common tasks within three steps

☐ Critical info visible at a glance

Key Impacts
• Faster decisions

• Lower error rates

• Improved performance under pressure

5. Physical Usability — Real Environments
☐ Readable in sunlight/low light

☐ High contrast displays

☐ Glove-friendly targets

☐ Minimal precision gestures

☐ Usable while moving

Key Impacts
• Reliable field usability

• Reduced input errors

• Improved mission effectiveness

6. Automation Trust — Appropriate Reliance
☐ Strengths and limits communicated

☐ Uncertainty indicators present

☐ No black-box behavior

☐ Operators remain engaged

Key Impacts
• Prevents overreliance

• Reduces complacency risk

• Improves safety margins

7. Mode Awareness — No Surprises
☐ Active mode labeled

☐ Mode changes obvious

☐ No hidden states

☐ Clear alerts during transitions

Key Impacts
• Improves situational awareness

• Reduces confusion

• Supports faster response

8. Temporal Awareness — Trends Over Time
☐ Timeline/history available

☐ Changes visible over time

☐ Replay or debrief capability

Key Impacts
• Improves training

• Supports analysis

• Enhances system understanding

9. Error Tolerance — Safe Recovery
☐ Undo available

☐ Confirmation for destructive actions

☐ Safe defaults

☐ Clear recovery paths

Key Impacts
• Reduces incidents

• Limits consequences of errors

• Improves resilience
