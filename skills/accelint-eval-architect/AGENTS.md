# Eval Architect — Agent Reference

Quick-reference for the `accelint-eval-architect` skill. Load specific
references only when the workflow step in `SKILL.md` names them.

## Target types
- **skill** — a skill in this repo (`SKILL.md` at root). Assessment reads files.
- **tool-repo** — a standalone tool repo, esp. a RAG/retrieval pipeline. Assessment reads what it can, then **interviews the developer** for stages + invocation.

## Modes (one-line each)
- **ASSESS** — read/interview the target → eval profile → verifiability gate (per stage for pipelines) → framework recommendation. Read-only.
- **SCAFFOLD** — copy a framework starter, generate the walking skeleton, wire the build, hand off calibration.
- **AUDIT** — run the decay checklist against an existing `evals/` dir.

## Rules (one-line; full reasoning in SKILL.md "NEVER" section)
- Deterministic check before judge — always.
- Generate goldens from the live schema; never hand-write them.
- Thresholds start record-only; calibrate from a baseline before committing numbers.
- One fixture / one metric / one pass test / one regression test — skeleton, not suite.
- Every metric needs a regression test that proves it can fail.
- Derive persona×scenario from the skill; flat fixtures when single-mode.
- Commit eval source before the first run.
- Match harness toolchain to the target (vitest for Node, pytest for Python).
- Taste-based output → human-review checklist, not an LLM judge.
- Pipeline targets: run the verifiability gate per stage (ingest/retrieve are usually deterministic; only generate needs a judge).
- RAG gold sets are human-curated; never trust a bootstrap draft as-is.
- Tool-repo comprehension is interactive; confirm stages + invocation before recommending.

## Scope
Scaffolds: DeepEval, Ragas (RAG answer layer), deterministic-vitest, deterministic-pytest, deterministic-retrieval (ingest+retrieve), human-review.
Tool-repo support: RAG / retrieval pipelines.
Recommends-but-hands-off (no scaffold yet): Promptfoo, Inspect AI, non-RAG tool types.
