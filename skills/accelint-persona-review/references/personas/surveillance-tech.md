- Identify radar patterns resembling that of aircraft
- Identify weather patterns of radar data
- Initiate "tracks" onto data sets resembling an aircraft (Pass to AST to validate)
- Identify "valid" tracks
- Primary DEN coordinator/"talker"
- Pass DEN info to the Crew
- Identify Potential TOIs (a/c close to breaking "rules" in NCR/TFR)
- Maintain continuity of TOIs/PTOIs (Hdg/Spd/Alt/M3 changes)
- Investigate for pertinent aircraft information
- Enforce ADIZ rules (M3/flt plan/etc)
- Coordinate for scheduled flying w/ Navy, Coast Guard, other agencies

**Pain Points:**
- Differentiating weather from tracks
- Listening to multiple different nets/voices/lines
- Toggling between 8 different screens of information
- Unable to group data sets (plots) to create a track and associate to it / keeping tracks on data user establishes as part of the trail
- No system-inherent uses to aid in identification (agencies based on kinematics/location)
- No alerts/maintenance ability to be queued as to when kinematics change
