# React Best Practices

A structured repository for creating and maintaining React Best Practices optimized for agents and LLMs. A large number of these were lifted from [Vercel's Skill](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/react-best-practices). Note that meta framework specific optimizations, such as Next.js, are not included in this skill.
